# Bike Sharing Demand Prediction 🚲📊

## Overview
This project predicts **hourly bike rental counts** using historical data and weather information.  
The dataset comes from the **[Bike Sharing Demand Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand)**.

## Data & Features
- **Training & Test Data:** Kaggle dataset  
- **Key Features:**  
  - Hour of the day, day of the week, month  
  - Weather conditions, temperature, humidity, windspeed  
  - Working day / holiday indicators  

## Project Highlights
- Explored the dataset with **visualizations** and **correlation analysis** to find patterns in bike usage.  
- Trained several machine learning models:  
  - **Linear Regression**  
  - **Random Forest Regressor**  
  - **Gradient Boosting Regressor** → best performance  
- Calculated the most **influential features** for bike demand.  
- Analyzed demand trends for **morning/evening peaks and weekends**.
